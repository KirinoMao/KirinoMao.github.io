			<a style="font-weight: bold">Sam</a><a>: I know. It's all wrong. By rights, we shouldn't even be here. </a>
			<p>But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.</p>
			<p>The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. </p>
			<p>And sometimes you didn't want to know the end, </p>
			<p>because how could the end be happy?</p>
			<p>How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?</p>
			<p>But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow.</p>
			<p>Even darkness must pass. A new day will come.</p>
			<p>And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.</p>
			<p>Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.</p>
			<p>Even if you were too small to understand why.</p>
			<p>But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.</p>
			<p>I know now. </p>
			<p>Fold in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.</p>
			<p>They kept going because they were holding on to something.</p>

			<br>
			<p></p>
			<a style="font-weight: bold">Frodo</a><a>: What are we holding on to, Sam?</a>

			<br><br>
			<p></p>
			<a style="font-weight: bold">Sam</a><a>: There is some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for!</a>
